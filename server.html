      <p class="title">Julian Network Server</p>
      <p class="subheading">The Beginning</p>
      <p>At first, a Minecraft server was just an idea to ButterBoyJulian, the owner of the server. Julian had the idea of making a server to connect many small servers that don't have a lot of players to create a mega-network. Over time this idea changed but his original thought still stays present in the server.</p>
      <p class="subheading">The Alpha Era</p>
      <p>The Julian Network Minecraft Server was created on Monday, October 16, 2017. In 2017, it was originally a factions server but because of a huge error, the owner accidentally reinstalled a backup dated when the server was created.</p>
      <p>After that disaster, the server turned into what we now call Enchanted Survival. It had custom enchants and crates at spawn. This did not last however, the server was later turned into a Bungeecord network.</p>
      <p class="subheading">The Beta Era (Now)</p>
      <p>After the alpha era of the servers history the owner created the minigame server which featured dozens of minigames, like murder mystery, skywars and gamebox. Later, Gamebox was moved to the hub server to people could join, explore spawn and play short and quick minigames.</p>
      <p>The server remains to still be in its beta phase. This is because there is still a list of errors that need fixing on the server. After this, the server will be released and the owner will start getting as many players online the server as possible.</p>
