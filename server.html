      <p class="title">Julian Network Server</p>
      <p class="subheading">The Beginning</p>
      <p>At first, a Minecraft server was just an idea to ButterBoyJulian, the owner of the server. Julian had the idea of making a server to connect many small servers that don't have a lot of players to create a mega-network. Over time this idea changed but his original thought still stays present in the server.</p>
      <p class="subheading">The Alpha Era</p>
      <p>The Julian Network Minecraft Server was created on Monday, October 16, 2017. In 2017, it was originally a factions server but because of a huge error, the owner accidentally reinstalled a backup dated when the server was created.</p>
      <p>After that disaster, the server turned into what we now call Enchanted Survival. It had custom enchants and crates at spawn. This did not last however, the server was later turned into a Bungeecord network.</p>
      <p class="subheading">The Beta Era</p>
      <p>After the alpha era of the servers history the owner created the minigame server which featured dozens of minigames, like murder mystery, skywars and gamebox. Later, Gamebox was moved to the hub server to people could join, explore spawn and play short and quick minigames.</p>
      <p>While the server is still in its beta phase, there is still a list of errors that need fixing on the server. After this, the server will be released and the owner will start getting as many players online the server as possible.</p>
      <p>But just before entering the Pre Release Era, a doomsday button was created after the server when into maintenance for a whole day. It was born on June 1st 2020, its function was to make sure people were interested in the server. Everyday the button would go down by 20% battery life and if it reached 0% the server would be shutdown. It is not known what would happen after the doomsday event...</p>
      <p class="subheading">The Pre Release Era (Now)</p>
      <p>On June 25, 2020 the server was now in its pre release phase. At this point the owner started to move and seprate the minigame server into individual servers to fix a major bug left.</p>
      <p>Bedwars was the first server to be seprated. After this Build Battle, Skywars, TNTRun and Murder Mystery would later be seprated, any server not listed would either be removed or added later.</p>
      <p>On March 27th, 2021 the server now allowed Bedrock Edition users to join (IP: "play.julian-network.com" Port: 25574). Along with bug fixes and new custom features were added.</p>
